# Using SDSS imaging to predict galaxy spectroscopic properties 

Here we use convolutional neural networks (CNNs or convnets) to process 
Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) false-rgb images and predict galaxy 
properties that are determined from spectroscopic observations.

We also use overlap with the Galaxy Zoo data set to train better 
estimators of certain galaxy properties (e.g., BPT classification).
